# THIS SCRIPT CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK.
- RuneLite has changed how their window is handled.
- AHK commands such as WinMove do not work as intended.
- If the client issue is fixed, the code will receive a revamp.

---

# How To Setup:
- Edit the variables at the top of the script to initialize client size, start position, and transpose offset used in the loop
- The script will then find each client, then set the correct size, and offset the clients

# Hotkeys:
- F10 will organize OSRS Steam client windows
- F11 will organize RuneLite client windows
- F12 will organize RuneScape client windows
